### **ABSTRACT:**
This project proposes the development of a nutrition-tracking mobile
application designed to assist users in monitoring their dietary intake,
identifying nutritional deficiencies, and receiving personalized dietary
recommendations. The app will utilize a user-friendly interface for
tracking food intake, perform comprehensive nutritional analysis, and
employ AI algorithms to generate tailored suggestions. By collecting and
analyzing user data, the app aims to provide valuable insights into
general nutritional trends and dietary patterns across demographics and
contribute to improving public health outcomes. The project encompasses
technical, operational, economic, and schedule feasibility assessments
to ensure its successful implementation.
